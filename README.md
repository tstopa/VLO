In this repository you'll find some introductory lectures and materials on quantum computing.
1) You should start with lectures 1-4
2) Then you should use graphical composer at [quantum.ibm.com](https://quantum.ibm.com/) to implement Deutsch algorithm
3) You can then explore Deutsch-Jozsa and implement it also in Composer
4) Finally, you can install Qiskit and run the notebook witrh Grover algorithm
5) The attached lecture explaining Grover algorithm can be used to understand more on Grover and play with it in the notebook
